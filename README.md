# MudPi Smart Garden
> A python library to gather sensor readings, trigger components, control solenoids and more in an event based system that can be run on a raspberry pi.


## Documentation
For full documentation visit [mudpi.app](https://mudpi.app/docs)


## Installation
Install MudPi using the [Installer](https://github.com/mudpi/installer) that will guide you through the process. You can also view the [manual install instructions](https://github.com/mudpi/installer/blob/master/docs/MANUAL_INSTALL.md)


## Guides
For examples and guides on how to setup and use MudPi check out the [free guides available.](https://mudpi.app/guides)


## Contributing
Any contributions you can make will be greatly appreciated. If you are interested in contributing please get in touch with me and submit a pull request. There is much more I would like to add support for, however being a single developer limits my scope. Therefore mainly bugs will be accepted as issues.
